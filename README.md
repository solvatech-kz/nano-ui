# üöÄ NanoUI

NanoUI is a high-performance, lightweight component library for React, built on the principles of **zero-dependency** and maximum optimization. The project is fully **open-source** and distributed without restrictions.

## üí° Why NanoUI?

Most popular UI libraries for React (Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, shadcn/ui) suffer from excessive weight, a large number of dependencies, and a rigid attachment to specific styling tools. This results in:

- Increased bundle size and load times.
- Limited customization flexibility.
- Challenges in integrating with projects requiring high performance.

Additional dependencies also increase the risk of **version conflicts** and **supply chain attacks**, such as substitution or compromise of third-party packages. NanoUI's **zero-dependency** architecture completely eliminates these risks, as the final build contains no external dependencies that could become an attack vector.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

NanoUI is designed with modularity, component isolation, and minimal bundle size in mind.

### 1. Complete Component Isolation

- Own style module (**CSS Modules**).
- Local design tokens defined within the component.
- Built-in default parameters with overrides via `props` and CSS variables.
- No dependency on global themes, CSS, or utility classes.
- **Guaranteed no style conflicts** when integrating into any project.

### 2. Zero-dependency and Secure Delivery

- No external runtime libraries: no CSS frameworks, CSS-in-JS solutions, or UI packages.
- The build process does not pull in transitive dependencies, eliminating `supply chain` risks.
- All functionality is implemented internally and undergoes unified auditing.

### 3. Optimization for Tree-shaking

- Each component is a separate **entry-point**.
- Styles are imported only within the component.
- No global CSS file ‚Äî the bundle contains only the styles of used components.

### 4. SSR-ready by Default

- Styles are loaded together with the component.
- In SSR environments (Next.js, Remix), CSS is automatically inlined into the HTML response.
- **FOUC** (_flash of unstyled content_) is prevented by preloading critical styles.

### 5. Styling via CSS Variables

- Design tokens implemented with **CSS Variables** in the component's root element.
- Supports dynamic theming and style changes without rebuild.
- Tokens can be locally overridden per component instance.

### 6. Minimizing Duplication

- Common styles are implemented as internal utilities, not global classes.
- Variables and utilities are reused in the source code but are excluded from the bundle if unused.

### 7. Flexible Integration

- Works with **Vite, Webpack, Next.js, Parcel**.
- Partial integration ‚Äî import only needed components.
- Supports **ESM** and **CJS** for maximum compatibility.

### 8. Accessibility by Default (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- All interactive components follow **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility guidelines.
- Semantic HTML elements and correct `role` / `aria-*` attributes are used for assistive technologies.
- Focus styles are clearly visible and consistent across all components.
- Color palettes and contrasts meet the AA standard for readability.
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported (Tab, Enter, Space, Escape, Arrow keys).
- Dynamic elements announce state changes to screen readers.

- `Radio Group` ‚Äî group of radio buttons.
- `Switch` ‚Äî toggle switch.
- `Select` ‚Äî dropdown list with custom styling.
- `Slider`, `Range Slider` ‚Äî sliders.
- `File Upload` ‚Äî file upload component.
- `Color Picker` ‚Äî color selection tool.

### Forms & Validation

- `Form`, `FormField` ‚Äî wrappers for working with forms.
- `Password Input` ‚Äî password field with show/hide option.
- `Search Input` ‚Äî search field with icon and quick clear.

### Information Display

- `Card`, `Table`, `List`.
- `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Divider`.
- `Tooltip`, `Popover`, `Accordion`, `Tabs`.
- `Progress`, `Skeleton`, `Empty State`.

### Modals & Notifications

- `Dialog` / `Modal`.
- `Drawer` / `Sidebar`.
- `Toast`, `Alert`, `Confirm Dialog`.

### Navigation

- `Breadcrumbs`, `Pagination`, `Steps`.
- `Navbar`, `Sidebar Navigation`, `Command Palette`.

### Media

- `Image`, `Video Player`, `Audio Player`.

### Graphics & Visualization

- `Chart Wrapper`, `Stat`.

### Other
